## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements the classic Tic Tac Toe game with an emphasis on clean UI design, smooth interactions, and robust game logic. It supports both **Player vs Player** and **Player vs AI** modes, allowing users to play against another human or a computer opponent.

The application is developed using vanilla JavaScript to reinforce core frontend concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, state management, and algorithmic problem-solving.
